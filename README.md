# A simple demo for ReplayKit in iOS

Who doesn't love playing games on their iPhone? I think that my friends and family would agree that I waste way too much time on my phone playing games. However, games are one of the many things that show off the incredible things an iPhone can do with its crazy power and beautiful display.

Almost everyone who loves playing games on their iPhone loves to brag to their friends how great they are at them. That is why Apple announced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/replaykit"> ReplayKit</a> at WWDC15 along with iOS 9. ReplayKit is an incredible API which makes it extremely simple for developers to integrate safe and efficient screen recording into their apps. This way, with a tap of a button, players can record their game and instantly share it with their friends. Now before you say it, I know that iOS 11 introduced a way to record your screen anywhere, but that feature is not as intuitive for gamers as it requires control center to be opened, and also requires that the user leaves the game to edit and send the video. ReplayKit is made specifically for gamers.

Today, I am going to show you how to make a simple screen recording app. The app will feature a recording start/stop button, a label that shows the status of the recording, and some UI elements to play with so you can record yourself doing something. Lets get started!
